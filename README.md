# gwc-map-code-along
Simple Google Maps API code along I built for my Girls Who Code class

## File Structure
* Files with "starter" in the name are the starter files. 
* Files for each phase of the code-along have "part [number]" in their names.
* Final product is in index.html, index.js, and index.css files.
* Each of the "starter" and intermediate phase files contains comments with steps for that phase.
* At present, there's only one simple phase to this code-along, but I may add more later.
