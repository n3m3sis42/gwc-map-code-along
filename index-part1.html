<!-- Step 1: Copy link to Maps API script into file in another script tag. Look at basic API doc to understand next steps. -->
<!-- Step 2: Briefly discuss "async defer" in script tag linking Google Maps API -->
<!-- Step 3: Briefly discuss "callback" and maybe look at slide for callback functions. Discuss order of script tags. -->
<!-- Step 4: Can google "async defer w3schools" or use this link - https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_script_defer.asp -->
<!-- Step 5: Add in API key (mine or one of the TAs'). -->
<!-- Step 6: Update JS file with initMap function (see steps noted in Part 1 JS file) -->
